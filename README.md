Iris PL - just a fun-project. Interpritating (on Python, heh) with pre-compiling code into the blocks

Currently, this language supports: variable assignments, functions (nested, too), different contexts, conditions, all the operators which python has. Also supports math expressions, comments, data types (numbers[int, float], boolean, strings), etc.

In the next release, I'm planning to add try/except blocks, loops, and more datatypes
